# 📝 Story Submission Workflow - FIXED VERSION

## 🎯 Complete Workflow Overview

### 1. **User Submits Story** (`pages/submit.html`)

- User fills out form with title, content, author name, category
- Form validation ensures all required fields are present
- Content is checked for basic moderation (harmful words)
- Story data is collected and sanitized

### 2. **Immediate Publication** (`js/database-manager.js`)

- Story is inserted into `stories` table with status `approved`
- All required fields are mapped correctly to database schema
- Category is linked to `categories` table via category_id
- Reading time is automatically calculated
- Published timestamp is set immediately
- Story is LIVE immediately - no approval needed

### 3. **Success Confirmation** (`pages/success.html`)

- User is redirected to success page with story ID
- Story details are displayed for confirmation
- User can immediately view their published story

### 4. **Public Display** (`pages/stories.html`)

- All approved stories are shown to public immediately
- Stories are displayed with author info and categories
- Search and filtering functionality available
- New stories appear instantly after submission
